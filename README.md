timeconvert
===========

A web implementation of a time converter

Hello world! This is my first real individual software project and most of it is just for practise rather than actually shipping a product.

Hopefully when the project is completed, a pretty website will allow you to input two cities and a time in one of them. After some fairly simple maths it will display what the time will be in city B given the time in city A.

Thanks for stopping by! :)
